# Numerical Variant of the Analytical Wall Function (AWF)
This repository contains the numerical solution, implementation and validation of the AWF for the Betts & Bokhari cavity in the open-source CFD code, **Code_Saturne v5.0.8** by EDF Energy. Further information and details of the proposed approach can be found in:
